        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h:outputText value="Riding on the waves of a worldwide phenomenal growth of consumer interest in home decoration and environmentally-friendly furniture products, as well as a strong local growth of consumer interest in ready-to-assemble yet stylish furniture, Merlion Investment Holding (Merlion) has invested S$1 billion for the establishment of a 60,000m² world-class furniture manufacturing and retailing store, Island Furniture. Island Furniture aims to acquire and retain a large market share of the customers who seek quality, modern and eco-friendly furniture at affordable prices.
The following System Proposal details Kent Ridge Technology’s (KRT) proposed Furniture Management System (FMS), a custom enterprise resource planning (ERP) system for the global investment advisory panel of Merlion Investment Holding catered for Island Furniture. "/>
        <br/><br/><h2>Our Business</h2>
        <h:outputText value="This is where FMS comes in – a structural necessity that supports Island Furniture in accomplishing its business objectives. Based on preliminary research and discussions with Island Furniture stakeholders, our team has uncovered the key business problems and processes that should be addressed, and correspondingly, drawn out the strategic ways FMS can resolve these issues and achieve key business objectives and requirements.
We follow an agile software development methodology, which allows for speed and flexibility. Members work together in pairs to develop sub-modules simultaneously. New iterations are being constantly produced by our team, which allows us to gather feedback from our clients at a relatively frequent basis. We believe this would increase the client’s satisfaction level as we are able to immediately address their major concerns before the final system release. After the implementation, we will continue to support the enterprise system through providing user training and regular system maintenance.
